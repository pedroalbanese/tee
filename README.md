### tee implementation in golang
The tee command is a Unix-like command-line utility that enables reading input from a data stream, such as the output of a program, while simultaneously redirecting and writing that input to one or more specified files. It is commonly used to capture and save the output of a command to a file while still displaying it in the terminal.
